## Project Description

This project aims to help students understand algorithms and how they act when changing their input in a dynamic visual way.

We are building a website that has the implementation of 8 different algorithms, most of them are connected to Machine Learning, their input is received from the user via GUI in the website and the output is the output of the chosen algorithm displayed in a visual way (drawing on a graph for example).
