## Project Description

This project aims to help students understand algorithms and how they act when changing their input in a dynamic way.

I am building a website that has the implementation of 8 different algorithms, 7 of them are ML algorithms, their input is received from the user via GUI in the website and the output is the output of the chosen algorithm is visually displayed (like plotting a graph).


## Requirements
   - Python
   - Django
   - Numpy
   - Matplotlib
   - Pip for Python package and environment management.


## Project setup

1. Create virtual environment `python -m venv .venv`

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - on Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - on Windows: `source .venv/Scripts/activate`

3. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Create `.env` file in the `setup` folder with such environment variables:

   `SECRET_KEY=<some_secret_value>`

5. Start a Django application `python manage.py runserver`

6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
