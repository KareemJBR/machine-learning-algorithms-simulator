## Project Description

This project aims to help students understand algorithms and how they act when changing their input in a dynamic way.

I am building a website that has the implementation of 8 different algorithms, 7 of them are ML algorithms, their input is received from the user via GUI in the website and the output is the output of the chosen algorithm is visually displayed (like plotting a graph).
