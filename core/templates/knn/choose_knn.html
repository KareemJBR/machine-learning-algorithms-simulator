    <h1>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</h1>

    <p>
      In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric supervised learning method first
      developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for
      classification and regression.
    </p>

    <p>
      In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set. The output depends on whether
      k-NN is used for classification or regression:
    </p>

    <p>
        In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors,
        with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically
        small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
    </p>

    <p>
        In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k
        nearest neighbors.
