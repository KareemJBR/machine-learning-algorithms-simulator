    <h1>Naive Bayes Classifier</h1>

    <p>In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying
      Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features</p>
    <p>Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables
        (features/predictors) in a learning problem.</p>
    <p>Naive Bayes classifiers are often extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.</p>
    <p>Naive Bayes classifiers have very low memory requirements.</p>
    <p>They can be extremely useful even if their assumptions donâ€™t hold, which is very
      common in practice.</p>
    <p>Naive Bayes classifiers are often very easily interpretable, providing a nice probability
        distribution over the classes for each input.</p>
    <p>Naive Bayes classifiers can be very easily updated, which makes it possible to stream data.</p>
    <p>Naive Bayes classifiers are often very good in practice, even if their theoretical
      justification for why they work is shaky.</p>
