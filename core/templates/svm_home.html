    <h1>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h1>

    <p>
      In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning
      models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an
      SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a
      non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a
      probabilistic classification setting).
    </p>

    <p>
      An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space,
      mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.
      New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side
      of the gap they fall on.
